Greetings from Smart City Society! We have recently transited to a student club under the Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (IIE) and renamed ourselves from SMU Anthill Society to SMU Smart City Society. We will still be focusing on Smart Cities and its related technologies that help urbanization problems through various avenues such as talks, workshops and hackathons.  Additionally, we are now a student chapter of Association for Public Affairs (APA). Do check our Instagram page for more details, and look out in this space for more updates!
