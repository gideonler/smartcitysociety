At the start of the year, we had our first ever event - the Smart Nation Primer. It was a collaboration with Smart Cities Network where 6 teams of SMU students got to work with 6 different Singapore-based industry partners from various industries for a smart city project. Our student also got to interact with MSc Students at Georgetown University. Check out the projects our students have done under our projects page!
