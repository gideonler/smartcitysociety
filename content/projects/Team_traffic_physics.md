By using real-time open source dataset of traffic images, Team Traffic Psychics created a Computer Vision model that analyses vehicular density at a particular location. By doing so they were able to calculate corresponding emissions data to monitor total harmful gas emissions of an area. Their analysis is also shown on a simple and intuitive dashboard.
