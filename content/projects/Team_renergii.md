As part of the Smart Nation Primer, Team SMU-Renergii worked on an analysis of Circularity in the Built Environment, with a case study on Singapore. 

The scope of their analysis looked at the 5 different building blocks of the built environment - Buildings, Transportation, Water, Waste and Energy. Using the circularity framework by the Ellen Macarthur Foundations, the group analyzed the circularity of current strategies adopted by Singapore and identified business opportunities for circularity innovation.
