For the Code for Cities hackathon organized by SMU Anthill and Surbana Jurong, Team TonTon chose to tackle the area of Food Security in Singapore. Their solution was to conduct vertical farming at HDB rooftops and pedestrian bridges, so that Singapore would reduce food reliance from other countries. As part of their analysis, they've also used machine learning models like clustering to cluster farms together based on their natural conditions and Artificial Neutral Networks to predict the future natural conditions of farms.
