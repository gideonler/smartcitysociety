The scope of their analysis looked at the 5 different building blocks of the built environment - Buildings, Transportation, Water, Waste and Energy. Using the circularity framework by the Ellen Macarthur Foundations, the group analyzed the circularity of current strategies adopted by Singapore and identified business opportunities for circularity innovation.</description></item><item><title>Geospatial Analysis of Foreign Workers Dormitories in Singapore</title><link>http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/team_niftie/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/team_niftie/</guid><description>As part of the Smart Nation Primer, Team Niftie @ SMU did a geospatial visualization of locations of foreign workers dormitories in Singapore. Using the folium library in python, the students plotted a heatmap to show the distribution of the location of the dormitories.</description></item><item><title>Real time Geospatial Analysis of harmful gas emissions</title><link>http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/team_traffic_physics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/team_traffic_physics/</guid><description>By using real-time open source dataset of traffic images, Team Traffic Psychics created a Computer Vision model that analyses vehicular density at a particular location. By doing so they were able to calculate corresponding emissions data to monitor total harmful gas emissions of an area. Their analysis is also shown on a simple and intuitive dashboard.</description></item><item><title>Save Water Wally</title><link>http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/teamwonkies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/teamwonkies/</guid><description>In their proposed solution for the Code for Cities hackathon orgainzed by SMU Anthill and Surbana Jurong, Team Wonkies seeks to tackle the problem of water wastage in Singapore via a complementary 2-pronged approach, a mobile phone application, SaveWaterWally, and an external smart detector. Their solution seeks to help users cultivate water saving habit and reduce water wastage in Singapore by tracking and analyzing water usage data.</description></item><item><title>Vertical Farming to solve Food Security problems in Singapore</title><link>http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/team_tonton/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/team_tonton/</guid><description>For the Code for Cities hackathon organized by SMU Anthill and Surbana Jurong, Team TonTon chose to tackle the area of Food Security in Singapore. Their solution was to conduct vertical farming at HDB rooftops and pedestrian bridges, so that Singapore would reduce food reliance from other countries. As part of their analysis, they&amp;rsquo;ve also used machine learning models like clustering to cluster farms together based on their natural conditions and Artificial Neutral Networks to predict the future natural conditions of farms.</description></item></channel></rss>
