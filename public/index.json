We have recently transited to a student club under the Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (IIE) and renamed ourselves from SMU Anthill Society to SMU Smart City Society. We will still be focusing on Smart Cities and its related technologies that help urbanization problems through various avenues such as talks, workshops and hackathons. Additionally, we are now a student chapter of Association for Public Affairs (APA).","date":"2019-01-19T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/news/wearesmartcitysociety/","tags":["shortcodes","privacy"],"title":"We are Smart City Society!"},{"categories":null,"contents":"about","date":null,"permalink":"http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We are a student club under the Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (IIE) which aims to value-add student experiences in the field of Smart-City Management and Technology through workshops which incorporate topical discussions on Smart City issues. Our members will also get to participate in workshops and hackathons, and apply technologies such as analytics and IoT to help solve urbanization problems.\nOur club began in 2019 as SMU Anthill Society as an Special Interest Group under Ellipsis, the student representative body of the SMU School of Computing \u0026amp; Information Systems (SCIS).","date":null,"permalink":"http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/page/aboutus/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":null,"contents":"As part of the Smart Nation Primer, Team SMU-Renergii worked on an analysis of Circularity in the Built Environment, with a case study on Singapore.\nThe scope of their analysis looked at the 5 different building blocks of the built environment - Buildings, Transportation, Water, Waste and Energy. Using the circularity framework by the Ellen Macarthur Foundations, the group analyzed the circularity of current strategies adopted by Singapore and identified business opportunities for circularity innovation.","date":null,"permalink":"http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/projects/team_renergii/","tags":["projects"],"title":"Analysis of the Built Environment"},{"categories":null,"contents":"exco","date":null,"permalink":"http://smusmartcitysociety.github.io/exco/","tags":null,"title":"Exco"},{"categories":null,"contents":"As part of the Smart Nation Primer, Team Niftie @ SMU did a geospatial visualization of locations of foreign workers dormitories in Singapore.
